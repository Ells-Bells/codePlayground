# Assignment 3
#
#   Using the main file, create a function that will complete each of the below
#   'mini' tasks. I would like the main function to be formatted as below:
#   main():
#       partA()
#       time.sleep(5)
#       partB()
#       time.sleep(5)
#       partC()
#       time.sleep(5)
#       etc...
#
# A.  Tell me the current date/time
#
#
# B.  Output the current python version being used (Hint: import 'sys')
#
#
# C.  When i type my first and last name, say it back to me in the format:
#     lastname, firstname
#
#
# D.  Tell me what items 1 and 4 of this list are:
#     holidayPack = ["clothes","shoes","sunglasses","factor 50","tickets"]
#
# 
# E.  When I type a letter, tell me if the letter I typed is a vowel or not
#
#
# F.  Optimise the code I asked you to write in the main file if you think
#     it can be done
##

# There are a total of 6 marks avaliable, with a bonus 5 for
#  optimised code.
#
# Good luck
#     And remember, when the fun stops, stop!
