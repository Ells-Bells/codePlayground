# Assignment 2
# A.  Create a program that when run will tell the user
#      how long until this assignment is due.

# B.  Extend the program such that exactly 3 seconds after
#      telling the user the remaining time, they are given
#      a warning that its Friday the 13th.
#
# C.  If you have not already, comment your code.
#
#
# There are a total of 5 marks avaliable, with a bonus 5 for
#  optimised code.
